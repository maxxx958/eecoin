block structure:
    previous_hash + "one eecoin for me" + proof_of_work

proof_of_work is a random number that is added at the end of the block to make it's hash have exactly 30 (or x) zeros at the beginning.

to verify if the block is correct you can just hash it and count zeros at the beginning

to verify if the block is successor of some other block you just have to check if the previous_hash matches the last block

how can some other block be faster than us if we start looking sooner than he does?
(just randomize looking for the blocks, don't jsut iterate over the range)

everyone should start looking immidiately after receiving the block







MAYBE

if someone received enough transactions (first x of them) then he starts looking for the ~proof_of_work~
but then, how do we number transactions? should we even bother coming up with the system or just assume that
these come already numbered and just number them in our tests?
